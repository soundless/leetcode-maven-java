 *
 *
 * Given a non-negative integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the
 * result has only one digit.
 *
 *
 *
 * For example:
 *
 *
 * Given num = 38, the process is like: 3 + 8 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2. Since 2 has only
 * one digit, return it.
 *
 *
 * Follow up:
 * Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime?
 *
 *
