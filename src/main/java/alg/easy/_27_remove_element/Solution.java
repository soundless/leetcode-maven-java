 *
 * Given an array and a value, remove all instances of that value in-place and
 * return the new length.
 *
 *
 * Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying
 * the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
 *
 * The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave
 * beyond the new length.
 *
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Given nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3,
 *
 * Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums
 * being 2.
