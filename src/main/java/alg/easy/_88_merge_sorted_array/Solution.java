 * Given two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 into nums1 as
 * one sorted array.
 *
 *
 * Note:
 * You may assume that nums1 has enough space (size that is greater or equal to
 * m + n) to hold additional elements from nums2. The number of elements
 * initialized in nums1 and nums2 are m and n respectively.
