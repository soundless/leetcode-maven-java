 * Testcase Example:  'No intersection: []\n[]'
 *
 * Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly
 * linked lists begins.
 *
 * For example, the following two linked lists:
 *
 * A:          a1 → a2
 * ⁠                  ↘
 * ⁠                    c1 → c2 → c3
 * ⁠                  ↗
 * B:     b1 → b2 → b3
 *
 * begin to intersect at node c1.
 *
 * Notes:
 *
 * If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
 * The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function
 * returns.
 * You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
 * Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.
 *
 *

 * Credits:Special thanks to @stellari for adding this problem and creating all
 * test cases.
