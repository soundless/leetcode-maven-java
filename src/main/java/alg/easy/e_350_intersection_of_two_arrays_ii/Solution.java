 *
 *
 * Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.
 *
 *
 * Example:
 * Given nums1 = [1, 2, 2, 1], nums2 = [2, 2], return [2, 2].
 *
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * Each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both
 * arrays.
 * The result can be in any order.
 *
 *
 *
 * Follow up:
 *
 * What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your
 * algorithm?
 * What if nums1's size is small compared to nums2's size? Which algorithm is
 * better?
 * What if elements of nums2 are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such
 * that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?
 *
