 * Testcase Example:  '[[1,0,1],[0,-2,3]]\n2'
 *
 * Given a non-empty 2D matrix matrix and an integer k, find the max sum of a
 * rectangle in the matrix such that its sum is no larger than k.
 *
 * Example:
 * Given matrix = [
 * ⁠ [1,  0, 1],
 * ⁠ [0, -2, 3]
 * ]
 * k = 2
 *
 *
 *
 * The answer is 2. Because the sum of rectangle [[0, 1], [-2, 3]] is 2 and 2
 * is the max number no larger than k (k = 2).
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * The rectangle inside the matrix must have an area > 0.
 * What if the number of rows is much larger than the number of columns?
 *
 *

 * all test cases.
