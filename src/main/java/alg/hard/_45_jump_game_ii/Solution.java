 *
 * Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the
 * first index of the array.
 *
 *
 * Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that
 * position.
 *
 *
 * Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.
 *
 *
 *
 * For example:
 * Given array A = [2,3,1,1,4]
 *
 *
 * The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. (Jump 1 step from
 * index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.)
 *
 *
 *
 * Note:
 * You can assume that you can always reach the last index.
