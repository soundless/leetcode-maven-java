 * Total Submissions: 10.3K
 * Testcase Example:  '[[1,1],[2,2],[2,0],[2,4],[3,3],[4,2]]'
 *
 * There are some trees, where each tree is represented by (x,y) coordinate in
 * a two-dimensional garden. Your job is to fence the entire garden using the
 * minimum length of rope as it is expensive. The garden is well fenced only if
 * all the trees are enclosed. Your task is to help find the coordinates of
 * trees which are exactly located on the fence perimeter.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: [[1,1],[2,2],[2,0],[2,4],[3,3],[4,2]]
 * Output: [[1,1],[2,0],[4,2],[3,3],[2,4]]
 * Explanation:
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: [[1,2],[2,2],[4,2]]
 * Output: [[1,2],[2,2],[4,2]]
 * Explanation:
 *
 * Even you only have trees in a line, you need to use rope to enclose
 * them.
 *
 *
 *
 * ‚Å†Note:
 *
 * All trees should be enclosed together. You cannot cut the rope to enclose
 * trees that will separate them in more than one group.
 * All input integers will range from 0 to 100.
 * The garden has at least one tree.
 * All coordinates are distinct.
 * Input points have NO order. No order required for output.
