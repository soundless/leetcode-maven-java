 *
 * Nearly every one have used the Multiplication Table. But could you find out
 * the k-th smallest number quickly from the multiplication table?
 *
 *
 *
 * Given the height m and the length n of a m * n Multiplication Table, and a
 * positive integer k, you need to return the k-th smallest number in this
 * table.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: m = 3, n = 3, k = 5
 * Output:
 * Explanation:
 * The Multiplication Table:
 * 1    2    3
 * 2    4    6
 * 3    6    9
 *
 * The 5-th smallest number is 3 (1, 2, 2, 3, 3).
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: m = 2, n = 3, k = 6
 * Output:
 * Explanation:
 * The Multiplication Table:
 * 1    2    3
 * 2    4    6
 *
 * The 6-th smallest number is 6 (1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 6).
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * The m and n will be in the range [1, 30000].
 * The k will be in the range [1, m * n]
