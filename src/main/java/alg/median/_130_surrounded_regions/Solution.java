 * Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all regions
 * surrounded by 'X'.
 *
 * A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded

 * X O O X
 * X X O X
 * X O X X
 *
 *

 *
 * After running your function, the board should be:
 *
 * X X X X
 * X X X X
 * X X X X
 * X O X X
