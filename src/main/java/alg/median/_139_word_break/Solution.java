 * Testcase Example:  '"leetcode"\n["leet","code"]'
 *
 *
 * Given a non-empty string s and a dictionary wordDict containing a list of
 * non-empty words, determine if s can be segmented into a space-separated
 * sequence of one or more dictionary words. You may assume the dictionary does
 * not contain duplicate words.
 *
 *
 * For example, given
 * s = "leetcode",
 * dict = ["leet", "code"].
 *
 *
 *
 * Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".
 *
 *
 *
 * UPDATE (2017/1/4):
 * The wordDict parameter had been changed to a list of strings (instead of a
 * set of strings). Please reload the code definition to get the latest
 * changes.
