 *
 * A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors.
 *
 * Given an input array where num[i] ≠ num[i+1], find a peak element and return
 * its index.
 *
 * The array may contain multiple peaks, in that case return the index to any
 * one of the peaks is fine.
 *
 * You may imagine that num[-1] = num[n] = -∞.
 *
 * For example, in array [1, 2, 3, 1], 3 is a peak element and your function
 * should return the index number 2.

 *
 * Note:
 * Your solution should be in logarithmic complexity.
