 * Testcase Example:  '7\n[2,3,1,2,4,3]'
 *
 *
 * Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s, find the
 * minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum â‰¥ s. If there isn't
 * one, return 0 instead.
 *
 *
 * For example, given the array [2,3,1,2,4,3] and s = 7,
 * the subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.
