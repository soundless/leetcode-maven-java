 *
 *
 * Given a list of daily temperatures, produce a list that, for each day in the
 * input, tells you how many days you would have to wait until a warmer
 * temperature.  If there is no future day for which this is possible, put 0
 * instead.
 *
 * For example, given the list temperatures = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73],
 * your output should be [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0].
 *
 *
 * Note:
 * The length of temperatures will be in the range [1, 30000].
 * Each temperature will be an integer in the range [30, 100].
