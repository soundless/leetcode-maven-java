 * Testcase Example:  '[1]\n1'
 *
 * Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth
 * smallest element in it.
 *
 * Note:
 * You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ BST's total elements.
 *
 * Follow up:
 * What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to
 * find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest
 * routine?
 *
 * Credits:Special thanks to @ts for adding this problem and creating all test
 * cases.
