 * Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a
 * sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or
 * transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in
 * the same or another computer environment. 
 * 
 * Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary search tree. There
 * is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should
 * work. You just need to ensure that a binary search tree can be serialized to
 * a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree
 * structure.
 * 
 * 
 * The encoded string should be as compact as possible.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note: Do not use package algorithms.leetcode.median.m_449_serialize_and_deserialize_bst;

class member/global/static variables to store states. Your
 * serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.
