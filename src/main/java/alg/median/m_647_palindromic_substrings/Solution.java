 * Given a string, your task is to count how many palindromic substrings in
 * this string.

 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: "abc"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: "aaa"
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".
