 * Follow up for "Search in Rotated Sorted Array":
 * What if duplicates are allowed?
 *
 * Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?
 *
 *
 * Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown
 * to you beforehand.
 *
 * (i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).
 *
 * Write a function to determine if a given target is in the array.
 *
 * The array may contain duplicates.
